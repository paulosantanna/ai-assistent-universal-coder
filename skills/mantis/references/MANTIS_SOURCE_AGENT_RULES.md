# Agent Rules

## Before committing

**Always run `pre-commit run --all-files` before creating or amending a
commit.**

This ensures all markdown files conform to the pinned mdformat 0.7.21 formatter
(`--number --wrap 80` with gfm + frontmatter plugins). The hook installs its own
isolated venv — do not run local `mdformat` directly.

If the hook modifies files, stage the changes and amend your commit.

## Verbatim blocks

Blocks A/B/C/D/E/F/G are wrapped in ```` ``` ```` fences and must stay
**character-identical** across all skills. Never insert content *inside* their
fences — add notes *after* the closing ```` ``` ```` instead.

## Reference files

Skills may split on-demand content into `references/` subdirectories (e.g.
`mantis-calibrate/references/calibration_rules.md`). Before committing, verify
that every `references/*.md` link target in a `SKILL.md` file exists on disk and
is tracked by git (`git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>`).

### Extraction criteria

Extract a block into a `references/` file only if ALL three hold:

1. **Off the fail-closed safety-critical path** — the extracted content is not
   the sole authority for a security-critical invariant (e.g. the
   `VERIFIED_SECURE => reattack_status = failed_to_bypass` gate).
2. **Restates no invariant** — the extracted content does not restate any rule
   that is also stated in the SKILL.md (no invariant may appear in both a
   SKILL.md and its reference; if a rule must be referenced, state it once and
   point to it).
3. **Clean fail-safe fallback** — if the reference cannot be loaded, the skill
   falls back to safe behavior without the reference (e.g. patch rebasing falls
   back to fresh patch generation, verified by Block G).

`mantis-patch/references/patch_rebasing.md` qualifies (pure mechanics, no
invariant restated, fails safe to Phase-1). Do not extract content that restates
a crown-jewel invariant — trim it inline instead.

## Structural index spec

The structural index spec lives in **one canonical location**:
`mantis-structural-index/SKILL.md`. Two other files reference it — the adapter
blueprint stub (`mantis-pipeline-adapter/references/mantis-structural-index.md`)
and the adapter Guideline 9 (`mantis-pipeline-adapter/SKILL.md`). Before
committing changes that touch any of these three files, verify:

1. The blueprint stub is under 50 lines, links to
   `mantis-structural-index/SKILL.md`, and contains **no**
   `MANTIS_HELPER_VERSION`.
2. The adapter Guideline 9 `MANTIS_HELPER_VERSION` matches the canonical
   `SKILL.md` version.
3. The Block A verbatim fence (LOCATOR RESOLUTION) appears **only** in the
   canonical `SKILL.md` — never in the stub or the adapter.
