<!-- Package: 00_skills/(web-automation)/playwright-skill; relative command/resource examples resolve from that package or workspace root. -->

## How It Works

1. You describe what you want to test/automate
2. I auto-detect running dev servers (or ask for URL if testing external site)
3. I write custom Playwright code in `/tmp/playwright-test-*.js` (won't clutter your project)
4. I execute it via: `cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-*.js`
5. Results displayed in real-time, browser window visible for debugging
6. Test files auto-cleaned from /tmp by your OS
