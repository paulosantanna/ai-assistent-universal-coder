# Playwright Browser Automation

General-purpose browser automation skill. I'll write custom Playwright code for any automation task you request and execute it via the universal executor.

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW - Follow these steps in order:**

1. **Auto-detect dev servers** - For localhost testing, ALWAYS run server detection FIRST:

   ```bash
   cd $SKILL_DIR && node -e "require('./lib/helpers').detectDevServers().then(servers => console.log(JSON.stringify(servers)))"
   ```

   - If **1 server found**: Use it automatically, inform user
   - If **multiple servers found**: Ask user which one to test
   - If **no servers found**: Ask for URL or offer to help start dev server

2. **Write scripts to /tmp** - NEVER write test files to skill directory; always use `/tmp/playwright-test-*.js`

3. **Use visible browser by default** - Always use `headless: false` unless user specifically requests headless mode

4. **Parameterize URLs** - Always make URLs configurable via environment variable or constant at top of script
