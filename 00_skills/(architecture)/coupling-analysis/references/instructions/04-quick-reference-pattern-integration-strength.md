## Quick Reference: Pattern → Integration Strength

| Pattern found                        | Integration Strength       | Action                               |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Reflection to access private members | Intrusive                  | Refactor urgently                    |
| Reading another service's DB         | Intrusive                  | Refactor urgently                    |
| Duplicated business logic            | Functional (symmetric)     | Extract to shared module             |
| Distributed transaction / Saga       | Functional (transactional) | Evaluate if cohesion would be better |
| Mandatory execution order            | Functional (sequential)    | Document protocol or encapsulate     |
| Rich domain object returned          | Model coupling             | Create integration DTO               |
| Internal enum shared externally      | Model coupling             | Create public contract enum          |
| Use-case-specific DTO                | Contract coupling          | ✅ Correct pattern                   |
| Versioned public interface/protocol  | Contract coupling          | ✅ Correct pattern                   |
| Anti-Corruption Layer                | Contract coupling          | ✅ Correct pattern                   |
