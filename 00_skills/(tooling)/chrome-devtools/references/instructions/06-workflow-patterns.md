## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern A: Identifying Elements (Snapshot-First)

Always prefer `take_snapshot` over `take_screenshot` for finding elements. The snapshot provides `uid` values which are required by interaction tools.

```markdown
1. `take_snapshot` to get the current page structure.
2. Find the `uid` of the target element.
3. Use `click(uid=...)` or `fill(uid=..., value=...)`.
```

### Pattern B: Troubleshooting Errors

When a page is failing, check both console logs and network requests.

```markdown
1. `list_console_messages` to check for JavaScript errors.
2. `list_network_requests` to identify failed (4xx/5xx) resources.
3. `evaluate_script` to check the value of specific DOM elements or global variables.
```

### Pattern C: Performance Profiling

Identify why a page is slow.

```markdown
1. `performance_start_trace(reload=true, autoStop=true)`
2. Wait for the page to load/trace to finish.
3. `performance_analyze_insight` to find LCP issues or layout shifts.
```
