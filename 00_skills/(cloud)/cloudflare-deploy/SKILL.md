# Cloudflare Deploy

Governance: CodENavi Full Workspace v2. Skill of `codenavi-agent`; inherit `AGENTS.md`.
Lifecycle: BRIEFING → RECON → PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY → DEBRIEF.
Source roles/workers are internal lenses. Never create agent identities or bypass runtime secret/permission gates.

## Mission

Deploy applications and infrastructure to Cloudflare using Workers, Pages, and related platform services.

## Workflow and module routing

Read the contract/input/security modules before tools; then follow the applicable procedure in the original order. Load optional modes only when their scope applies.

- 1. [Purpose and contract](references/instructions/01-purpose-and-contract.md) — before acting on this contract.
- 2. [Prerequisites](references/instructions/02-prerequisites.md) — when this domain or mode is in scope.
- 3. [Authentication (Required Before Deploy)](references/instructions/03-authentication-required-before-deploy.md) — when this domain or mode is in scope.
- 4. [Quick Decision Trees](references/instructions/04-quick-decision-trees.md) — when this domain or mode is in scope.
- 5. [Product Index](references/instructions/05-product-index.md) — when this domain or mode is in scope.
- 6. [Troubleshooting](references/instructions/06-troubleshooting.md) — when an input, tool or check fails.

## Boundaries and result

Use only tools actually available for the authorized task. Keep secrets in runtime providers. Missing evidence, inputs or permissions blocks the affected action. Return the domain output with source pointers, executed checks and remaining uncertainty; never claim an unexecuted check passed.

## TLC source

For the catalog workflow and its local resources, read [TLC contract](references/tlc/UPSTREAM.md). Apply root governance and the local constraints above; upstream does not grant extra authority.

Provenance and source freshness: [provenance](references/provenance.md).

Example usage and failure handling: read [usage and verification](references/usage-and-verification.md) when selecting this skill or a required step fails.
