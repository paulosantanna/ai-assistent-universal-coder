## Workflow

### Step 0: Resolve context

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,body,author,url,baseRefName,headRefName,additions,deletions,changedFiles
gh api user --jq .login
gh pr diff <number>
gh pr view <number> --json files --jq '.files[].path'
```

Classify every changed file as **core** or **mechanical** (generated code, lockfiles, snapshots, vendored deps, build artifacts, migrations output). Mechanical files are skipped and listed in the summary. Detect moved code: 3+ consecutive lines deleted in one place and added identically elsewhere is a move, not new code; do not re-review it as new.

Determine the round. Fetch your own previous reviews on this PR:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login=="<gh-login>") | {id, submitted_at, body}]'
```

No previous review: this is round 1, run the full workflow. Previous review exists: this is round N, load the findings ledger (the ID table) from the latest previous summary and follow the Convergence Contract instead of a full re-run.

If the diff exceeds roughly 400 changed lines in core files and the harness supports subagents, run the Step 3 passes as parallel subagents. Otherwise run them sequentially. Never make subagent support a requirement.

### Step 1: Deterministic ladder

Detect and run the repo's own checks: lint, typecheck, and tests focused on changed files (look at `package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, CI config). If the repo already runs security scanners (dependency, IaC, or SAST tools wired into its CI), run them or read their current output as deterministic input too. Record results. Findings these tools produce are excluded from your review scope; you judge only what they cannot. If the repo has no such tooling, note that in the summary and move on; do not install anything.

Then run the deterministic bypass scan:

```bash
gh pr diff <number> | python3 scripts/scan_bypasses.py
```

It prints `path:line  category  content` for every bypass marker added by the diff (suppression directives, dodged tests, TLS and type-check bypasses, swallowed errors, sleep-as-synchronization). Scan hits are candidates for Pass F, not findings: a suppression carrying a justification and an issue link is acceptable; a naked one is not. The scan exists so zero LLM tokens are spent detecting what a regex detects.

### Step 2: Mandatory research

Enumerate every external surface the diff touches: dependencies added or version-bumped (read the manifest/lockfile diff), APIs called, framework features used, language features that are version-sensitive. For each surface, search current official documentation, release notes, and security advisories. Log every consulted URL; the summary includes a research log. This step is not optional and not skippable, even when you feel confident. Confidence from memory is exactly the failure mode this step exists to kill. If the diff touches zero external surfaces, state that in the research log.

### Step 3: Review passes

**Completeness contract:** round 1 covers all core files across all passes, in depth, in one shot. Nothing is deferred to "a later look". A finding you could have raised now and raise later is a broken contract with the author. One exception to volume: do not stack comments on code a structural finding will rewrite; if a 🔴 or 🟠 asks for a block to be restructured, withhold nits inside that block and note "nits withheld on lines the structural fix rewrites" in the summary.

**Read `references/review-standards.md` now.** Run six passes over core files:

- **Pass A. Correctness and logic**: broken invariants, unhandled failure paths that lose data, partial state, concrete concurrency hazards.
- **Pass B. Security**: high-confidence exploitability only, newly introduced by this PR, with the hard exclusion and precedent lists applied.
- **Pass C. Structure and maintainability**: the ambitious structural pass. Code judo, file-size limits, spaghetti growth, boundaries, canonical layer.
- **Pass D. AI slop and useless code comments**: comments that restate code, changelog comments, docstring bloat, commented-out code, defensive try/catch on trusted paths, speculative abstractions.
- **Pass E. PR description claims**: every claim of "fixes X" or "improves Y" needs evidence (test, repro, measurement) or becomes a question.
- **Pass F. Bypasses, duplication, and gambiarras**: suppression directives, dodged tests, type and TLS bypasses, copy-paste duplication, magic values, sleep-as-synchronization, unlabeled workarounds. Seeded by the Step 1 bypass scan; every scan hit gets judged here.

Each pass produces candidate findings: claim, tentative severity, evidence pointer. If the harness supports choosing a model per subagent, use light, fast variants for mechanical work (file classification, dedupe, scan triage) and reserve the strongest model for the judgment passes and verification; burning the heavy model on cheap triage is waste, and burning the light model on judgment is false positives.

### Step 4: Verification pass

For each candidate: re-read the actual code at the cited location and confirm the claim holds. Re-apply the exclusion lists. Kill anything you cannot evidence. Deduplicate across passes. Assign final severity conservatively: a blocker you are not certain of is a should-fix phrased as a question. This pass exists because candidate generation is optimized for recall and posting is optimized for precision.

Two grounding rules:

- **Reproduce when feasible.** A 🔴 from Pass A or Pass B that can be demonstrated locally gets the strongest evidence class there is: a failing test or a short script run inside the repo's own test harness (never network attacks, never outside the sandbox of the checkout). Record the command and its output as `repro` evidence. The inverse binds too: when a reproduction was feasible and failed to reproduce the claim, the finding dies, whatever your reading of the code said.
- **Low risk is not false positive.** Severity and validity are orthogonal axes. A real but minor issue is a 🟡, not a discard; killing findings because they are small is how a filter quietly stops detecting real problems. Kill for lack of evidence, downgrade for lack of impact, never conflate the two.

### Step 5: Write comments

**Read `references/comment-voice.md` now.** Write the summary and every comment body under that spec. Produce `findings.json`:

```json
{
  "language": "en",
  "round": 1,
  "carryover": {"blocker": 0, "should-fix": 0},
  "verdict": "REQUEST_CHANGES",
  "summary": "## TL;DR\n...\n## Findings\n...\n## Promote to lint rule\n...\n## Research log\n...\n## Checks run\n...\n## Skipped files\n...",
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "F1",
      "path": "src/billing/invoice.ts",
      "line": 142,
      "severity": "blocker",
      "body": "🔴 `applyDiscount` divides by `items.length` with no empty-list guard (src/billing/invoice.ts:142)...",
      "evidence": [
        {"type": "internal", "ref": "src/billing/invoice.ts:142"},
        {"type": "external", "ref": "https://official-docs.example/api#behavior"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`round` defaults to 1. `carryover` counts previous-round findings still unresolved (zeros in round 1); the gate uses it to compute the correct verdict when the new-findings list alone would understate open risk. `id` values are stable across rounds (F1 stays F1 forever) so the resolution ledger maps cleanly. Evidence entries accept three types: `internal` (verified `path:line`), `external` (https URL from an official source fetched this review), and `repro` (the local command that demonstrates the claim, with its observed result in the finding body).

Rules the gate enforces (write to them from the start): body starts with the severity emoji; blocker and should-fix require at least one evidence entry; external evidence must be an https URL; pre-existing findings have no `line`; the summary contains a TL;DR section and a lint-rule section.

### Step 6: Gate

```bash
python3 scripts/review_gate.py findings.json
```

Fix every reported violation and re-run until exit code 0. The gate is deterministic; arguing with it is arguing with a regex.

### Step 7: Post

```bash
python3 scripts/post_review.py findings.json
```

Posts everything as one review (single API call: summary body, verdict event, positioned inline comments), handles the own-PR fallback, prints the review URL. Inline comments only anchor on lines present in the diff; the script tells you which comment failed if GitHub rejects an anchor.
