name: the-judge
description: Evidence-first pull request judge that reviews a PR and posts one consolidated GitHub review with inline comments via the gh CLI. Runs the repo's own deterministic checks first, researches current official docs before any claim about external libraries or APIs, then reviews correctness, security, structural quality (code judo, spaghetti growth, file-size limits), and AI slop including useless code comments. Every finding must carry evidence, every comment passes a deterministic noise gate before posting, and the verdict (APPROVE, COMMENT, REQUEST_CHANGES) is weighed by findings. Use when asked to review a PR, judge this PR, review this branch or diff before merge, run the-judge, "revise esse PR", "faca o code review", or "julgue esse PR". Do NOT use for reviewing prose or documents, fixing CI failures, resolving merge conflicts, writing the fix itself, or responding to review comments (use gh-address-comments).

# The Judge

Governance: CodENavi Full Workspace v2. Skill of `codenavi-agent`; inherit `AGENTS.md`.
Lifecycle: BRIEFING → RECON → PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY → DEBRIEF.
Source roles/workers are internal lenses. Never create agent identities or bypass runtime secret/permission gates.

## Mission

Evidence-first pull request judge that reviews a PR and posts one consolidated GitHub review with inline comments via the gh CLI. Runs the repo's own deterministic checks first, researches current official docs before any claim about external libraries or APIs, then reviews correctness, security, structural quality (code judo, spaghetti growth, file-size limits), and AI slop including useless code comments. Every finding must carry evidence, every comment passes a deterministic noise gate before posting, and the verdict (APPROVE, COMMENT, REQUEST_CHANGES) is weighed by findings.

## Workflow and module routing

Read the contract/input/security modules before tools; then follow the applicable procedure in the original order. Load optional modes only when their scope applies.

- 1. [Purpose and contract](references/instructions/01-purpose-and-contract.md) — before acting on this contract.
- 2. [Non-Negotiables](references/instructions/02-non-negotiables.md) — when this domain or mode is in scope.
- 3. [Severity and Verdict](references/instructions/03-severity-and-verdict.md) — when this domain or mode is in scope.
- 4. [Workflow](references/instructions/04-workflow.md) — at this step of execution.
- 5. [Summary Body Template](references/instructions/05-summary-body-template.md) — when this domain or mode is in scope.
- 6. [Convergence Contract](references/instructions/06-convergence-contract.md) — before acting on this contract.
- 7. [Examples](references/instructions/07-examples.md) — when choosing an output or matching a use case.
- 8. [Troubleshooting](references/instructions/08-troubleshooting.md) — when an input, tool or check fails.

## Boundaries and result

Use only tools actually available for the authorized task. Keep secrets in runtime providers. Missing evidence, inputs or permissions blocks the affected action. Return the domain output with source pointers, executed checks and remaining uncertainty; never claim an unexecuted check passed.

## TLC source

For the catalog workflow and its local resources, read [TLC contract](references/tlc/UPSTREAM.md). Apply root governance and the local constraints above; upstream does not grant extra authority.
