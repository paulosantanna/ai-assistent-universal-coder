## Design the judgments

Choose by what the answer means, then read the relevant primitive page:

| Need | Primitive | Important distinction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One of a defined set | [Choice](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/choice.md) | Picks one option; its distribution compares competing options |
| Whether a condition holds | [Noul](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/noul.md) | Probability of yes; no separate confidence; use one per label when several may apply |
| Degree along a described dimension | [Score](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/score.md) | Probability-weighted position on ordered levels; use comparable per-item Scores for graded ranking |

Give each question enough relevant **state** to answer: source text, identities,
relationships, policies, and current facts. Prefer named JSON fields when context
has several parts. Put the judgment in **instructions** and define its possible
answers in **criteria**. Question IDs are for code and are not sent to the model;
include complete meaning in the question. Reference nested state with backticked
paths such as `ticket.messages[0].text`.

Ask one narrow, coherent judgment per question. Split independently useful dimensions,
without destroying the relationship being judged. A bounded action selection or
contextual interpretation is valid; atomic does not mean literal fact extraction
or a one-sentence limit. Strings work for simple questions. Use structured objects
or arrays when definitions, contrasts, exclusions, or examples clarify instructions
or criteria. Score levels must describe concrete situations and stand on their own.

Keep the needed answers available. Include a no-match outcome when nothing may fit;
use a separate presence judgment when it is independently useful. For source-value
selection, check candidate coverage: the model cannot choose an omitted value.
